# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Pre-deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors (replaced `any` types)
2. ✅ Fixed ESLint warnings (configured rules to be warnings instead of errors)
3. ✅ Fixed unescaped entities (apostrophes)
4. ✅ Updated Next.js configuration for deployment
5. ✅ Created Vercel configuration file

## Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel project settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

## Important Notes

- The frontend currently expects a backend running on `http://localhost:8080`
- For production, you'll need to update the backend URL in Vercel environment variables
- All API routes in `/app/api/` are configured to proxy to the backend

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Set the environment variables
4. Deploy

## Backend Requirements

- Your backend must be accessible from Vercel's servers
- CORS must be configured to allow requests from your Vercel domain
- All API endpoints must be working and accessible

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that your backend is accessible
