I want to create an rsvp app(web and mobile) for different types of events(weddings, birthdays, thanksgiving, baby-shower etc), the person organizing the event will download the app, create an account and signin to get started. Once that is done, they will have to select the type of event, provide pictures and other details of the event that will be used to generate the event invitation. the invitatioin template will be generated using AI based on the information provided. there will be two types of invitation templates generated standard and premium. the user can edit and customize the invitation template that he/she likes from the invitations generated. the invitation will be sent(shared) to potential guests via whatsapp. a link to a form to be filled by the potential guests to indicate their presence for the event will be embeded on the invitation template, when a guests successfully fills out the form a unique qr code and a corresponding 8 digit alphanumeric code is generated for each guest who fills the form. the user can see from a dashboard all the guests who have filled the form.A scanner mobile app will be used at the gate on the day of the event to scan the qr code in order to admit the guest into the event reception. incase qr code doesn't work, guests can provide the alphanumeric code. the backend will be built with typescript and nestjs, database with postgresql and prisma orm, the web frontend with nextjs and mobile app with flutter. when sending the invitation form to my guests I want to embed the form in some clickable invitation template which the guest will open then click on it to open the form link. for example if i sent the invitation to you as a whatsapp message, it comes with a clickable link embeded in the invitation and the guest clicks it and it opens the form in a browser window and from there he/she fills it and gets his qr code and alphanumeric code. the qr and alphanumeric code must be unique for each person. how do i achieve this? list the steps first before we start coding. Also pictures will be stored in google cloud storage, the backend will be deployed to cloudrun. the pictures will be used to generate the invitation template. Once the qr code is showed to the guest, there should be two buttons under the qr code, one to copy and another to download the code in png format. I want to use vertex AI for the AI that will generate the invitation template based on the event type, pictures provided and information such as venue, date, time etc. there will be two types of invitations standard and premium. Premium invitations will be high quality invitations while standard will be just normal. any ideas about features of the invitation types? I want the E-R diagram of the system and other feature suggestions are welcome before we start coding
Before sending the invitation, the user will have to enter the number of expected guests and the cost of the sending the invitations will be calculated (depending on type of invitation selected standard or premium, premium are more expensive than standard). methods of payment include mtn mobile money, orange money and cards
